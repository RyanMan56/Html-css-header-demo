# HTML / CSS Header Demo
Just a quick nav bar demo to show my friend how to do equally spaced navigation bar components. Resizes accurately to any screen size, but doesn't include any media queries, so if screen size goes below a certain width parts of the nav bar will start to get cut off.

If I were to add to this in the future I would add a media query to change the navigation components to a hamburger menu when the screen goes below a certain width. But that was not the purpose of this exercise.
